### Transition Studio — MIT
A subset of the transition expressions in `src/fx/catalog.js`
(`STUDIO_TRANSITIONS`) adapts WebGL shaders from **Transition Studio**
(https://github.com/Rhitottam/transition-studio), rewritten into Cutflow's
expression language with documented changes. MIT License, Copyright (c) 2025

## Tools and libraries

### FFmpeg — GPLv3 / LGPL
Cutflow ships the `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` executables (via the npm packages
`ffmpeg-static` and `ffprobe-static`) as standalone programs it invokes.
FFmpeg is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 (some builds
LGPL v2.1+); the exact license text ships with the binary inside the app
package. **Source offer:** the corresponding FFmpeg source is available from
https://ffmpeg.org/download.html, and the exact build configuration from the
`ffmpeg-static` project (https://github.com/eugeneware/ffmpeg-static). The
Cutflow application itself is not a derivative work of FFmpeg and remains
MIT-licensed.

### Runtime and UI
- **Electron** (MIT) — https://www.electronjs.org — includes **Chromium**
  (BSD-style licenses; full notices ship inside the Electron distribution).
- **React / React-DOM** (MIT) — Meta Platforms, Inc.
- **Vite** (MIT), **electron-builder** (MIT).
- **lucide-react** icons (ISC).
- **onnxruntime-node** (MIT) — Microsoft Corporation.
- **Whisper** (whisper.cpp, MIT): not bundled — the binary and models are
  downloaded on first use, at the user's request, from the official
  whisper.cpp GitHub releases and HuggingFace.
- **Ultra-Light-Fast-Generic-Face-Detector** (MIT, © 2019 linzai) — the
  RFB-320 ONNX model used by auto-reframe's face tracking: not bundled —
  downloaded on first use, at the user's request, from the project's own
  GitHub repository, and verified by size and SHA-256 before use.

### Fonts
The bundled fonts (via Fontsource packages) are licensed under the **SIL
Open Font License 1.1** or **Apache License 2.0**, per family; each font
package in `node_modules/@fontsource*` carries its own license file.

### Dependencies overall
The full dependency set (369 packages) is licensed under permissive terms:
MIT, ISC, BSD (0/2/3-clause), Apache-2.0, OFL-1.1, BlueOak-1.0.0, CC-BY-4.0,
Python-2.0 and WTFPL — plus the GPL-3.0 item covered above (the ffmpeg-static
executable only; no GPL code is linked into the application).
